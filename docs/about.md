# About Kobol Team

The Kobol Team is a group of passionate people based in Singapore who love to build and design their own network and data storage appliances. Our background ranges from aerospace industry to data science, gathering a wide spectrum of engineering skills and experiences. We strongly believe in open source and always held the vision to create an open platform to let people express their creativity and hack around. Helios4, the Open Source and Open Hardware Network Attached Storage (NAS), was our first project and our way to contribute back to the OSS community. After this first successful project, we decided to create the company Kobol Innovations Pte. Ltd. and to put all our energy in extending our range of NAS products and solutions.
