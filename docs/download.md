### Known Limitations

- SDcard High Speed timing have compatibility issue with some brands.

    **Temporary workaround :** Disable UHS option/support.

    *Can be manually enable, refer to the following [page](/helios4/sdcard/).*

- During SATA heavy load, accessing SPI NOR Flash will generate ATA errors.

    **Temporary workaround :** Disable SPI NOR flash.

    *Can be manually enable, refer to the following [page](/helios4/spi/).*
